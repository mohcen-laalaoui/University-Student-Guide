# 🎓 University Major Advisor (Frontend Only)

This is a fully frontend web application designed to help new students determine their ideal university major. The app features an interactive chatbot that engages students in a conversation and suggests suitable majors based on their interests and responses.

## 🚀 Features

- Chatbot interface (`chatbot.js`)
- Predefined majors and data (`data.js`)
- Dynamic interaction logic (`script.js`)
- Responsive and clean design (`style.css`)
- No backend required — works entirely in the browser

## 📁 Project Structure
**├── index.html # Main HTML file
├── style.css # Styling and layout
├── chatbot.js # Chatbot functionality
├── data.js # Contains majors and related data
├── script.js # Main logic connecting chatbot with data
└── README.md # Project documentation**


## 🧠 How It Works

- The user interacts with a chatbot via `chatbot.js`.
- Based on answers, the chatbot queries predefined majors from `data.js`.
- `script.js` handles conversation flow and decision-making.
- Suggestions are then displayed to the user in a user-friendly format.

## 📦 How to Run
